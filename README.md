Create an app and a web client/website for students and professors to connect better and more professionally. My project idea is basically a modern take on BlackBoard. If my project idea does become a reality, professors will be able to assign homework, exams, quizzes, and whatever they please from the website (or the phone app if that’s their preference) to the students and set the dates and times. When a professor is done assigning the assignment, the app will have access to the student’s mobile phone native OS calendar and schedule it for them automatically. This way the students will have a much stronger connection to their class since everything is automatically scheduled to them with alerts and notifications. The students will have the ability to customize the alert system; for example, as a student, I can tell the app to remind me of a test 3 days prior, that also works for a quiz but 2 days prior instead, and finally a homework assignment maybe 5 days prior to when the professor scheduled it. 
I believe if this app did exist, students will be able to do much better at school due to the constant reminder and the ease of scheduling.

#Graphic User Interface Ideas:
The general idea behind the UI for this project will be to make it as simple and user-friendly as possible. I want everyone to be able to pick it up and use it with no issues. The UI needs to be intuitive, modern, and easily customizable for users.
